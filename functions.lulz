-- Named function definition...
function hypot [a b] do
	return sqrt add mul :a :a mul :b :b
end

-- ...can be called like this...
print hypot 3 4

-- ...or indirectly like this...
print apply :hypot [3 4]

-- ...and is completely equivalent to:
make hypot2 fn [a b] do
	return sqrt add mul :a :a mul :b :b
end

-- Just to make sure now.
print hypot2 3 4
