Lunar Logo
==========


Welcome to Lunar Logo, an experimental scripting language based on Logo and Lua, with a tiny core and very clean syntax, currently implemented as a stand-alone Python module. Example usage:

	$ ./lunar.py sqrt add mul 3 3 mul 4 4
	5.0

That's right, you can type Lunar Logo code at a Bash prompt without escaping it (within reason). For a bigger sample, put this code in a file, say `repl.lulz`:

	print [Welcome to Lunar Logo. Enter your commands, or BYE to quit.]
	while [true] do
		type >
		type space
		make cmd readlist
		if eq 0 count :cmd do
			continue
		end
		if eq bye lowercase first :cmd do
			break
		end
		foreach i results parse :cmd do
			if neq :i nil do
				show :i
			end
		end
	end

Now you can load it as follows:

	$ ./lunar.py load repl.lulz

Indeed, Lunar Logo doesn't need a built-in interactive mode because you can code one yourself in just a few lines!

Features
--------

- A blend of two programming languages famous for friendliness.
- First-class functions with lexical scoping (and blocks with dynamic scoping).
- Metaprogramming: code is data; the parser and evaluator are procedures in the language.
- Tiny core: under 200 lines of code in the prototype -- squeaky-clean code, too!
- Easily extensible and embeddable: many built-in procedures are literal one-liners.

Project goals
-------------

- A language that needs little or no escaping when embedded into string literals, command lines and such.
- A language that doesn't run *too* slowly when implemented in another interpreted language.
- A language that throws few exceptions. A surprising amount of modern languages in widespread use have other error handling mechanisms.

Uses
----

Lunar Logo is designed to be used as a command language for driving larger applications. Imagine a command-line parser that can understand any instructions rather than just flags and options!

History
-------

This is the second time I do a Logo dialect. [The first time around][ll] I kept much closer to the original language, but the result was a messy implementation that left much of the heavy lifting to individual procedures, and still didn't have much in the way of speed or capabilities.

Status
------

As of 26 January 2017, Lunar Logo supports over 100 procedures (you can find the list at the end of `lunar.py`). See the tutorial for an overview.

The software is considered alpha quality. It's been tested and debugged to a degree, and all the essentials should be working correctly, but some features are prone to change, especially error handling. Don't rely too much on them yet.
